# Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) model

This provides an easy to follow guide to building a simple RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) application using Pinecone and OpenAI's API. Users can ask the application questions about any YouTube video.

## Setup

1. Create a virtual environment and install the required packages:

```bash
$ python3 -m venv .venv
$ source .venv/bin/activate
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Create a free Pinecone account and get your API key from [here](https://www.pinecone.io/).

3. Create a `.env` file with the following variables:

```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY = [ENTER YOUR OPENAI API KEY HERE]
PINECONE_API_KEY = [ENTER YOUR PINECONE API KEY HERE]
PINECONE_API_ENV = [ENTER YOUR PINECONE API ENVIRONMENT HERE]
```

## Process

- Data Preparation: Structure your knowledge base (e.g., ScaleX Innovation information) for optimal retrieval. Consider formats like text files, CSV, or a database.
- Vectorization: Use OpenAI’s embedding models to convert textual data into vector representations, enabling efficient similarity search.
Retrieval Component: Choose a vector database (e.g., Faiss, Pinecone) to store and search the embeddings.
- LangChain Integration:
-- Create a chain for the retrieval process, querying your vector database.
-- Construct a chain for generating text (using OpenAI’s text generation models).
-- Combine the chains, feeding retrieved context into the text generation chain.
- Conversation Flow: Design the logic for how your chatbot interacts with users, incorporating the RAG system for informed responses.

## Key Points

- RAG augments standard chatbots with the ability to reference external knowledge sources.
- The quality of your data preparation directly impacts retrieval effectiveness.
- LangChain streamlines the integration of retrieval and generation components.
